# find_sequence_to_locate

Given,
We have to locate a drone that can be at any open block of the maze(randomly given in maze.txt). We don't know the initial position of the drone but we can control it's movement without any kind of feedback. We need to generate a sequence of command at the end of which, we know exactly where the drone is, regardless of it's initial position.

This Repository contains the algorithm to solve the above problem
Please check REPORT.docx for all details.
